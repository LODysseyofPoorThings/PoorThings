            <l>He gasped, gaped, groaned, writhed, sobbed</l>
            <l rend="right">and tore his hair</l>
            <l>then asked for details. That is how I learned</l>
            <l enjamb="y">he did not think that kissing hands is love.</l>
            <l>Love (<name type="person" ref="#wedder">Wedder</name> thinks) only deserves the name</l>

            <l>It took a while to find out what he meant.</l>
            <l>It seems that women who have not been wed</l>
            <l>by wedders like my <name type="person" ref="#wedder">Wedder</name> all possess</l>
            <l>a slip of skin across the loving groove</l>
            <l>where <name type="person" ref="#wedder">Wedderburns</name> poke their peninsula.</l>
            <l>This slip of skin he never found on me.</l>
            <l><q who="#wedder">And how do you explain the scar?</q> he asked,</l>
            <l>referring to a thin white line which starts</l>
            <l>among the curls above my loving groove</l>
            <l>and, like the Greenwich line of longitude,</l>
            <l>divides in two the belly Solomon</l>
            <l>has somewhere likened to a heap of wheat.</l>
            <l><q who="#bella">Surely all women’s stomachs have that line.</q></l>

            <l>I let him feel that crack which rings my skull</l>
            <l>just underneath the hair. He sighed and said,</l>
            <l><q who="#wedder" rend="beginQ">I told you everything <pc rend="emdash">—</pc> my inmost thoughts,</q></l>
            <l><q who="#wedder" rend="noQuotes">childhood and darkest deeds. Why did you not</q></l>
            <l><q who="#wedder" rend="endQ">speak of your past? Or rather, lack of past.</q></l>
            <l><q who="#bella" rend="beginQ">You never gave me time before tonight</q></l>

            <l>he yelled, then punched his head, burst into tears,</l>
            <l>pulled off his trousers, wed me very quick.</l>
            <l>I soothed him, babied him (he is a baby)</l>
            <l>and got him wedding at a proper speed.</l>
            <l>Yes, wed he can and does, but little <name type="person" ref="#candle">Candle</name>,</l>
            <l>if you are reading this do not feel sad.</l>
            <l>Women need <name type="person" ref="#wedder">Wedderburns</name> but love much more</l>
            <l>their faithful kindly man who waits at home.</l>
            <lb/>
            <l>I had a baby once. <name type="person" ref="#god">God</name>, is that true?</l>
            <l>If it is true what has become of her?</l>
            <l>For I am somehow sure she is a girl.</l>
            <l>This is a thought too b4wkkig for <name type="person" ref="#bella">Bell</name> to think.</l>
            <l>I must grow into it by slow degrees.</l>
            <lb/>
            <l><name type="person" ref="#god">God</name>, do you read the change there is in me?</l>
            <l>I am not quite as selfish as I was.</l>
            <l>I felt for <name type="person" ref="#candle">Candle</name> though he is not here</l>
            <l>and tried to comfort him. I start to fear</l>
            <l>the feeling that will grow if I think much</l>
            <l>about the little daughter I have lost.</l>
            <l>Strange how the baby-minded <name type="person" ref="#wedder">Wedderburn</name></l>
            <l>has taught this cracked and empty-headed Bell</l>
            <l>to be more feelingful for other folk.</l>
            <l>He managed it by making me his nurse</l>
            <l>when we reached <name type="place">Switzerland</name>. I’ll tell you how.</l>
            <lb/>
            <l>The jealousy which he had shown in <name type="place">London</name></l>
            <l>did not depart when we reached <name type="place">Amsterdam</name>.</l>
            <l>The only time we were not arm-in-arm</l>
            <l>was when he left me in a waiting-room</l>
            <l>to see a doctor for his lethargy <pc rend="emdash">—</pc></l>
            <l>that’s what he called the tiredness that he felt,</l>
            <l>which was quite natural. We all need rest,</l>
            <l>and time to sit and look and dream and think.</l>
            <l>The doctor’s pills let him dispense with rest.</l>
            <l>We rushed through racecourses and boxing-clubs,</l>
            <l>cathedrals, café-dansants, music-halls.</l>
            <l>His face was white, his eyes grew huge and shone.</l>
            <l><q who="#wedder">I am no weakling, <name type="person" ref="#bella">Bell</name>!</q> he cried. <q who="#wedder">On! On!</q></l>
            <lb/>
            <l>Thank you, dear <name type="person" ref="#god">God</name>, for teaching me to sleep</l>
            <l>by simply sitting down and shutting eyes.</l>
            <l>In omnibuses, trains, cabs, trams and boats</l>
            <l>this came in handy, but was not enough <pc rend="emdash">—</pc></l>
            <l>I had to find some other way to sleep.</l>
            <l>The second night abroad we went to see</l>
            <l>an opera by <name type="person" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner">Wagner</name>. It was long,</l>
            <l>and <name type="person" ref="#wedder">Wedder</name>, every time I shut my eyes,</l>
            <l>nudged me and hissed, <q who="#wedder">Wake up and concentrate!</q></l>
            <l>This taught me how to sleep with open eyes.</l>
            <l>Soon I could also do it standing up</l>
            <l>and rushing arm-in-arm from place to place.</l>
            <l>I think I answered questions in my sleep <pc rend="emdash">—</pc></l>
            <l>the only answer he required was, <q who="#bella">Yes dear.</q></l>
            <l>I always wakened up in our hotels,</l>
            <l>offices where I sent you telegrams</l>
            <l>(while <name type="person" ref="#wedder">Wedder</name> telegrammed to his mama)</l>
            <l>in restaurants, because I like my food,</l>
            <l>but nowhere else except the <name type="place" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_Zoo">Frankfort zoo</name></l>
            <l>and German betting-shop I will describe.</l>
            <lb/>
            <l>I think it was the smell which wakened me.</l>
            <l>This place (just like the zoo) stank of despair,</l>
            <l>and fearful hope, also of stale obsession</l>
            <l>which seemed a mixture of the first two stinks.</l>
            <l>My fancy nose perhaps exaggerated <pc rend="emdash">—</pc></l>
            <l>I opened eyes upon a brilliant room.</l>
            <l>Do you remember taking me to see</l>
            <l>the <name type="place" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Stock_Exchange">Glasgow Stock Exchange</name> It looked like that.</l>
            <l>Around me fluted columns, cream and gold,</l>
            <l>held up a vaulted ceiling, blue and white,</l>
            <l>from which hung shining crystal chandeliers</l>
            <l>which lit up all the business underneath <pc rend="emdash">—</pc></l>
            <l>six tables where smart people played roulette.</l>
            <l>Against the walls were sofas, scarlet plush,</l>
            <l>where more smart people sat, and one was me.</l>
            <l>And <name type="person" ref="#wedder">Wedderburn</name> was standing by my side,</l>
            <l>and gazing at the table nearest us,</l>
            <l>and muttering, <q who="#wedder">I see. I see. I see.</q></l>
            <l>I thought that he was talking in his sleep</l>
            <l>with open eyes, as I had done. I said,</l>
            <l>(gentle but firm) <q who="#bella" rend="beginQ">Let’s go to our hotel,</q></l>
            <l><q who="#bella" rend="endQ">dear <name type="person" ref="#wedder">Duncan</name>. I will put you into bed.</q></l>
            <l>He stared at me, then slowly shook his head.</l>

            <l>The people at the table turned to stare</l>
            <l>as we approached. One offered him a chair.</l>
            <l>He murmured thanks, and into it he slid.</l>
            <l>I stood behind to watch, as he had bid.</l>
