            <span>I am writing to you from the sea,</span><br/>
            <span>I had no peace to write before</span><br/>
            <span>we are afloat upon this blue blue sea.</span><br/>
            <span>Wedder is snug in bunk and glad at last</span><br/>
            <span>not to be do do doing all the time &#8212;</span><br/>
            <span>the silly chap has done some silly things.</span><br/>
            <span>How Auld Lang Syne seems that soft warm bright night</span><br/>
            <span>when I bade you good-bye, chloroformed Candle,</span><br/>
            <span>then skipped down ladder into Wedder&#8217;s arms.</span><br/>
            <span>Swift as the wind we spedin cab to train</span><br/>
            <span>and curtained carriage where we wed wed wed,</span><br/>
            <span>went wedding all the way to London town</span><br/>
            <span>and booked into Saint Pancras's Hotel.</span><br/>
            <span>And yet poor Duncan wanted marriage too!</span><br/>
            <span>He did not get it. Please tell Candle so.</span><br/>
            <span>You never wedded,  God, so may not know</span><br/>
            <span>eight hours of it takes much more out of men</span><br/>
            <span>than they can give without a lot of rest.</span><br/>
            <span>Next day was all my own. I saw some sights,</span><br/>
            <span>then waked my Wedder with a good high tea.</span><br/>
            <span><span class="quote">

            </span><br/>
            <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;you walked all day and never saw a man?&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
            
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">"No &#8212; I saw crowds of men but spoke to none,</span></span><br/>
            <span><span class="quote noquotes">except a policeman in Regent&#8217;s Park,</span></span><br/>
            <span><span class="quote noquotes">from whom I asked the way to Drury Lane."</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;Of course!&#8221;
        </span> he said. <span class="quote noquotes">"It would be the police!</span></span><br/>
            <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;They&#8217;re very tall and handsome are they not?&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
            <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;Guards officers are strong and handsome too.&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
            <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;They prowl the parks for girls who won&#8217;t say no.&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
            <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;Perhaps your policeman was in the Guards.&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">The uniforms are very similar."</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;Have you gone daft?&#8221;
        </span> I asked him. <span class="quote">
            &#8220;What is wrong?&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">"I&#8217;m not the only man you ever loved</span> &#8212;</span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">admit you have had hundreds before me!"</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">"Not hundreds &#8212; no. I never counted them,</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">but half a hundred might be about right."</span></span><br/>
            <span>He gasped, gaped, groaned, writhed, sobbed</span><br/>
            <span style="display: block; text-align: center;">and tore his hair</span>
            <span>then asked for details. That is how I learned</span><br/>
            <span>he did not think that kissing hands is love.</span><br/>
            <span>Love (Wedder thinks) only deserves the
               name</span><br/>
            <span>when men insert their middle footless leg.</span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">"If that is so Dear Wedder, rest assured</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">you are the only man I ever loved."</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;Liar cheat whore!&#8221;
        </span> he screamed. <span class="quote noquotes">"I am no fool!</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">You are no virgin! Who deflowered you first?"</span></span><br/>
            <span>It took a while to find out what he meant.</span><br/>
            <span>It seems that women who have not been wed</span><br/>
            <span>by wedders like my Wedder all possess</span><br/>
            <span>a slip of skin across the loving groove</span><br/>
            <span>where Wedderburns poke their peninsula.</span><br/>
            <span>This slip of skin he never found on me.</span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;And how do you explain the scar?&#8221;
        </span> he asked,</span><br/>
            <span>referring to a thin white line which starts</span><br/>
            <span>among the curls above my loving groove</span><br/>
            <span>and, like the Greenwich line of longitude,</span><br/>
            <span>divides in two the belly Solomon</span><br/>
            <span>has somewhere likened to a heap of wheat.</span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;Surely all women&#8217;s stomachs have that line.&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;No no!&#8221;
        </span> says Wedder. <span class="quote noquotes">"Only pregnant ones</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">who&#8217;ve been cut open to let babies out."</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;That must have been B.C.B.K.,&#8221;
        </span> I said,</span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;the time Before they Cracked poor Bella&#8217;s Knob.&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
            <span>I let him feel that crack which rings my skull</span><br/>
            <span>just underneath the hair. He sighed and said,</span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">"I told you everything &#8212; my inmost thoughts,</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;childhood and darkest deeds. Why did you not&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">speak of your past? Or rather, lack of past."</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">"You never gave me time before tonight</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;to tell you anything, you talked so much.&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;I thought you did not want to know my past,&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;my thoughts and hopes and anything of me&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">not obviously useful when we wed."</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">"You&#8217;re right &#8212; I am a fiend! I ought to die!</span></span><br/>
            <span>he yelled, then punched his head, burst into tears,</span><br/>
            <span>pulled off his trousers, wed me very quick.</span><br/>
            <span>I soothed him, babied him (he is a baby)</span><br/>
            <span>and got him wedding at a proper speed.</span><br/>
            <span>Yes, wed he can and does, but little Candle,</span><br/>
            <span>if you are reading this do not feel sad.</span><br/>
            <span>Women need Wedderburns but love much more</span><br/>
            <span>their faithful kindly man who waits at home.</span><br/>
            <br/>
            <span>I had a baby once. God, is that true?</span><br/>
            <span>If it is true what has become of her?</span><br/>
            <span>For I am somehow sure she is a girl.</span><br/>
            <span>This is a thought too b4wkkig for Bell to think.</span><br/>
            <span>I must grow into it by slow degrees.</span><br/>
            <br/>
            <span>God, do you read the change there is in me?</span><br/>
            <span>I am not quite as selfish as I was.</span><br/>
            <span>I felt for Candle though he is not here</span><br/>
            <span>and tried to comfort him. I start to fear</span><br/>
            <span>the feeling that will grow if I think much</span><br/>
            <span>about the little daughter I have lost.</span><br/>
            <span>Strange how the baby-minded Wedderburn</span><br/>
            <span>has taught this cracked and empty-headed Bell</span><br/>
            <span>to be more feelingful for other folk.</span><br/>
            <span>He managed it by making me his nurse</span><br/>
            <span>when we reached Switzerland. I&#8217;ll tell you how.</span><br/>
            <br/>
            <span>The jealousy which he had shown in London</span><br/>
            <span>did not depart when we reached Amsterdam.</span><br/>
            <span>The only time we were not arm-in-arm</span><br/>
            <span>was when he left me in a waiting-room</span><br/>
            <span>to see a doctor for his lethargy &#8212;</span><br/>
            <span>that&#8217;s what he called the tiredness that he felt,</span><br/>
            <span>which was quite natural. We all need rest,</span><br/>
            <span>and time to sit and look and dream and think.</span><br/>
            <span>The doctor&#8217;s pills let him dispense with rest.</span><br/>
            <span>We rushed through racecourses and boxing-clubs,</span><br/>
            <span>cathedrals, caf&#233;-dansants, music-halls.</span><br/>
            <span>His face was white, his eyes grew huge and shone.</span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;I am no weakling, Bell!&#8221;
        </span> he cried. <span class="quote">
            &#8220;On! On!&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
            <br/>
            <span>Thank you, dear God, for teaching me to sleep</span><br/>
            <span>by simply sitting down and shutting eyes.</span><br/>
            <span>In omnibuses, trains, cabs, trams and boats</span><br/>
            <span>this came in handy, but was not enough &#8212;</span><br/>
            <span>I had to find some other way to sleep.</span><br/>
            <span>The second night abroad we went to see</span><br/>
            <span>an opera by Wagner. It was long,</span><br/>
            <span>and Wedder, every time I shut my eyes,</span><br/>
      <span>nudged me and hissed, <span class="quote">
            &#8220;Wake up and concentrate!&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
            <span>This taught me how to sleep with open eyes.</span><br/>
            <span>Soon I could also do it standing up</span><br/>
            <span>and rushing arm-in-arm from place to place.</span><br/>
            <span>I think I answered questions in my sleep &#8212;</span><br/>
      <span>the only answer he required was, <span class="quote">
            &#8220;Yes dear.&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
            <span>I always wakened up in our hotels,</span><br/>
            <span>offices where I sent you telegrams</span><br/>
            <span>(while Wedder telegrammed to his mama)</span><br/>
            <span>in restaurants, because I like my food,</span><br/>
            <span>but nowhere else except the Frankfort zoo</span><br/>
            <span>and German betting-shop I will describe.</span><br/>
            <br/>
            <span>I think it was the smell which wakened me.</span><br/>
            <span>This place (just like the zoo) stank of despair,</span><br/>
            <span>and fearful hope, also of stale obsession</span><br/>
            <span>which seemed a mixture of the first two stinks.</span><br/>
            <span>My fancy nose perhaps exaggerated &#8212;</span><br/>
            <span>I opened eyes upon a brilliant room.</span><br/>
            <span>Do you remember taking me to see</span><br/>
            <span>the Glasgow Stock Exchange It looked like that.</span><br/>
            <span>Around me fluted columns, cream and gold,</span><br/>
            <span>held up a vaulted ceiling, blue and white,</span><br/>
            <span>from which hung shining crystal chandeliers</span><br/>
            <span>which lit up all the business underneath &#8212;</span><br/>
            <span>six tables where smart people played roulette.</span><br/>
            <span>Against the walls were sofas, scarlet plush,</span><br/>
            <span>where more smart people sat, and one was me.</span><br/>
            <span>And Wedderburn was standing by my side,</span><br/>
            <span>and gazing at the table nearest us,</span><br/>
      <span>and muttering, <span class="quote">
            &#8220;I see. I see. I see.&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
            <span>I thought that he was talking in his sleep</span><br/>
            <span>with open eyes, as I had done. I said,</span><br/>
      <span>(gentle but firm) <span class="quote noquotes">"Let&#8217;s go to our hotel,</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">dear Duncan. I will put you into bed."</span></span><br/>
            <span>He stared at me, then slowly shook his head.</span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote noquotes">"Not yet. Not yet. I have a thing to do.</span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;I know you inwardly despise my brain &#8212;&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;think it a mere appendage to my prick&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;and less efficient than my testicles.&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;I tell you Bella, that this brain now grasps&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;a mighty FACT which other men call CHANCE&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;because they cannot grasp it. Now I see&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;that GOD, FATE, DESTINY, like LUCK and&#8221;
        </span></span><br/>
      <span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><span class="quote">
            &#8220;CHANCE&#8221;

      <span><span class="quote">
            &#8220;are noises glorifying IGNORANCE&#8221;

      <span><span class="quote noquotes">Up, woman, and attend me to the game!"</span></span><br/>
            <span>The people at the table turned to stare</span><br/>
            <span>as we approached. One offered him a chair.</span><br/>
            <span>He murmured thanks, and into it he slid.</span><br/>
            <span>I stood behind to watch, as he had bid.</span><br/>
            <br/>
            Dear God I am tired. It is late. Writing like Shakespeare is <br/>hard work for a woman with a cracked head who cannot<br/>
               spell properly, though I notice my writing is getting smaller.<br/>
               Tomorrow we stop at Athens. Do you remember taking me<br/>
               there ages ago by way of Zagreb and Sarajevo I hope they<br/>
               have mended the Parthenon. Now I will creep to Wedder&#8217;s side and say<br/>
               what led to his collapse another day, ending this entry with a line of stars.
